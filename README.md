# JexiaBerries

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.4.

We want you to create a catalog of all the berries from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/), where you
can search, filter, and look at their profile information with:
- Name
- Growth time
- Maximum number of these berries that can grow on one tree
- The firmness of this berry
- Whatever more you think is important!

IMPORTANT: we would also like to know what other berries have a similar firmness and would like to see a link to their profile page(s).

It should have at least the following features:
- Catalog page with a list of berries, with filter and sort options
- Detail/profile page with the basic info and links to berries with the same firmness
- Nice UX, where you can use a component lib of your preference
